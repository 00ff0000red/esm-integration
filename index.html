<h1>WebAssembly Specifications</h1>

<p>
To support the *embedding* of WebAssembly in different environments, its specification is split into *layers* that are specified in separate documents.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Core specification: defines the semantics of WebAssembly modules and its instruction set, independent from a concrete embedding.
  The WebAssembly core is specified in a single document:

  <ul>
  <li><a href="core/">Core</a>: defines the structure of WebAssembly modules and its representation in binary and text format, as well as the semantics of validation, instantiation, and execution.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>API specifications: define *application programming interfaces* enabling the use of WebAssembly modules in concrete embedding environments.
  Currently, two APIs are specified:

  <ul>
  <li><a href="s-api/">JavaScript API</a>": defines JavaScript classes and objects for accessing WebAssembly from within JavaScript, including methods for validation, compilation, instantiation, and classes for representing and manipulating imports and exports as JavaScript objects.</li>

  <li><a href="web-api/">Web API</a>: defines extensions to the JavaScript API made available specifically in web browsers, in particular, an interface for streaming compilation and instantiation from origin-bound `Response` types.<li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
